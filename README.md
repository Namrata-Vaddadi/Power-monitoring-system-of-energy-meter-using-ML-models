# Power Monitoring System Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project presents a Power Monitoring System for energy meters using machine learning models. The goal was to analyze and predict power consumption accurately from energy meter data.

## Key Features
- Implemented several machine learning models for energy consumption prediction.
- Selected the best model based on evaluation metrics.
- Achieved an accuracy of 99% on test data predictions.
- Conducted experiments and testing using Google Colab environment.

## Technologies Used
- Python libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib
- Computing environment: Google Colab

## Project Structure
- `data/` — Dataset files for training and testing.
- `models/` — Saved machine learning models.
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks containing data analysis and model testing.
- `README.md` — Project documentation.
- `requirements.txt` — Project dependencies.

## Usage
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install required packages:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebooks or scripts in Google Colab to train models and test predictions.

## Results
- Achieved a test accuracy of 99% using the best machine learning model.
- Visualized data insights and prediction results using Matplotlib.

## Future Work
- Deploy the trained model for real-time monitoring.
- Expand dataset and explore additional features and models.
